<!--
For cameras that are handled by QuickTime, you can currently only 
choose the width and height using this configuration file.
set the camera ID to "0" if you want to omit the initial camera dialog,
setting the camera ID to "auto" shows the initial configuration options.

For IEEE1394 FireWire cameras all image settings are available,
and the camera can be selected by its bus ID.
